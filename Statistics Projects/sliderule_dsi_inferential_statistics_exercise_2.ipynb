    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value. Try using both the bootstrapping and the frequentist statistical approaches.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "The null hypothesis is that the proportion of callbacks for black sounding names is equal to the proportion of call backs for white sounding names.  A bootstrap hypothesis test generates many random samples of a shifted black call back dataset where the mean black callback proportion is shifted to zero. This shift is acheived by subtracting each black callback value by the mean of the  black callback population.  This shift to zero was similarly done to the white callback data where the mean white callback proportion is shifted to zero.  10,000 samples of randomly selected observations were taken from the white and black callback groups and each sample had a sample size of 10,000. The difference in mean of each pair of black and white callback samples is checked to see if it is less than or equal to the the empirical difference in mean of population. The proportion of the 10,000 samples that are less than or equal to the mean of the population signify if we can reject the null hypothesis.\n",

    "The original question was whether race has significant impact on the rate of callbacks for a resume. In order to figure out this question, a hypothesis test was set up to check if the difference of means in callback rate for black sounding names on resumes verse the difference of means in callback rate for white sounding names was stastically significant.  Two types of hypothesis tests were used, the bootstrap method and the frequentist method.  The p-value for the bootstrap method was 0.0.  This means 0% of the sampled applications had a mean difference between white and black sounding names that was greater than the emprirical mean. This means that the null hypothesis was reject and it was found that race does impact rate of callbacks for a resume.  In addition, the test statistic found with the frequentist method has a corresponding p-value less than 0.05 which means the null hypothesis can also be rejected using this test.   \n",

The larger the difference, the more important this field can be in callback success.  The difference between white and black sounding names only had an approximately 3% difference in callback rate.
