# Exploratory Data Analysis Mini Project


## Problem: What is the True Normal Human Body Temperature?
The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37C or 98.6F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?

## Approach
Analyze a dataset of human body temperatures and answer the following questions one by one by employing the concepts of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance.

1. Is the distribution of body temperatures normal?
2. Is the sample size large? Are the observations independent?
3. Is the true population mean really 98.6 degrees F?
4. Draw a small sample of size 10 from the data and repeat both frequentist tests.
5. At what temperature should we consider someone's temperature to be "abnormal"?
6. Is there a significant difference between males and females in normal temperature?


## Deliverables
1. EDA code in Python notebook.
