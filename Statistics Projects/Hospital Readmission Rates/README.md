## Problem: Hospital Readmissions Data Analysis and Recommendations for Reduction
In October 2012, the US government's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began reducing Medicare payments for Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with excess readmissions. Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, by dividing a hospital’s number of “predicted” 30-day readmissions for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia by the number that would be “expected,” based on an average hospital with similar patients. A ratio greater than 1 indicates excess readmissions.

## Approach
* Critique a preliminary analysis of readmissions data and recommendations for reducing the readmissions rate
* Construct a statistically sound analysis for readmissions data and recommend how to reduce the readmission rate. 


## Deliverables
1. EDA code in Python notebook.
