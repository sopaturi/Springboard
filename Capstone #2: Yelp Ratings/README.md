# Predicting Restaurant Review Sentiment from Yelp Reviews
## Soorya Paturi (sopaturi@gmail.com)
## Abstract
—Yelp reviews are a popular reference for
gauging a restaurant’s ability to provide a positive
experience. A Yelp review consists of a text review as
well as a star rating that is on a range of 1-5 stars.
The shortcomings of a text review is that a review may
contain sarcasm, ambiguity, or a play on words that
can be misconstrued as positive or negative. A sentiment
classifier for reviews will remove the need for sentiment
interpretation and replace the star rating system with
the percentage of people that left a positive review. The
goal is to predict sentiment (positive or negative) and
the likelihood of a positive review from a text review
and certain restaurant attributes because this prediction
removes the need for a star rating system. Star rating
systems offer too many options and their interpretation
is more subjective than the binary option of sentiment.

## Introduction to Report Above

Leaving a review on Yelp is the most common
way reviews for businesses are shared with potential visitors to a business. These reviews can
greatly influence a potential visitor’s decision to
visit the restaurant. Sentiment prediction on a text
review in Yelp provides clarity for the user on the
meaning of the review and adds another metric in
addition to the star based system.
Sentiment prediction is not deterministic because a review can take on many forms. However,
the objective is to find a relationship between text
review to sentiment, so that the likelihood of a
review being positive can be predicted.


The client interested in the results of this report is any company that currently accepts text
reviews for products or entities. The client should
care about sentiment prediction for these reviews
because ambiguous reviews can be identified as
positive or negative. A viewer of the review is
now clear on the intentions of the review when
the sentiment is listed alongside the review. With
a sentiment classifier, a user of a review site will
not have to leave a star rating because a positive or
negative sentiment will automatically be generated
from the review. A site with reviews can offer a
more conversational input style when describing a
business that does not always require someone to
state a star rating.


The outline of this report and the final report
is summarized here with Section II introducing
the data set. In Section III, the data wrangling
of the data set is summarized by explaining how
the data set was obtained, cleaned, and wrangled.
In Section IV, exploratory data analysis of the
data is summarized by a field by field analysis of
restaurant attributes that affect sentiment as well as
identification of words that are common in positive
and negative reviews. In the final report, Section
V will be added, and in it the prediction task is
described. In addition, the last section, Section VI,
conclusions and next steps are discussed in the
final report.
