    "   This notebook will introduce the problem that will be answered.  In addition, hypotheses will be made in order to aid in solving the problem as well as to start brewing insights on how to solve the problem.  The importance of solving the problem and how a company can use the resulting information will be looked at.  Finally, the data wrangling process will be conducted in order to clean the data set for future analysis. \n",

    "## Predicting the Likelihood of Acceptance for an H1B-LCA application\n",
    " \n",
    "An H1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows foreign born workers to enter the United States and work temporarily for up to three years with a possibility of extension for up to 6 years.  In order for a worker to receive an H1B visa, an employer must offer them a position and then submit an H1B visa application with the Department of Immigration.  H1B visas are commonly applied to by international students are who are looking to work after completing their education in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "A preliminary step before an H1B application can be filed is the submission of the LCA (Labor Condition Application) to the Department of Labor.  The LCA contains information about the job title being offered, duration of the job, whether job is full time, rate of pay, location of the job, and the prevailing wage in the area.  The purpose of the LCA is to bind the employer to agree to pay a fair wage and provide benefits to a foreign born worker that are equal to the prevailing wage and benefits at that occupation’s location.  In addition, the employer should provide the same working conditions to H1B applicants as other workers under the LCA application.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains one year worth of data from fiscal year 2017 and approximately 625,000 records of H1B-LCA application results.  I want to prevent employers from having their LCA application denied by identifying and communicating to the employer what the employment characteristics are for a high acceptance rate and low acceptance rate.  If the reason an application is denied is mainly due to the fields defined by the employer such as wage offered or worksite location, the employer will know what to change in their application in order to be certified.  The reason for H1B-LCA denial cannot be due to the employee because the application does not contain any information about the employee, only the employer.  In addition, I will be able to predict whether an employer’s prospective employee will have the LCA approved so that the employer can focus their time on changing characteristics about the job offered or the company so that an H1B-LCA is approved. \n",
    "\n",
    "My client is any company that wishes to hire a foreign born worker.  The client should care about H1B-LCA outcomes because they do not want to spend time filing and looking for candidates that will eventually not be certified with a successful H1B LCA application.  Based on my analysis, the employer will be able to find workers that are likely to be H1B-LCA certified by changing characterisitcs about the job offered to characteristics that have a high H1B-LCA certification rate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Initial hypotheses for a H1B-LCA application denial include the employer name, the job title, whether the job is part time or not, the difference between the prevailing wage and the wage offered by the employer, whether the employer is H1-B dependent, whether the employer is a willful violator,  and whether the employer agreed to the labor condition agreement subsection on the application.  A large difference between prevailing wage and wage offered means the employer is not giving a fair wage which could cause the application to be denied.  An employer having too many H1-B employees, being a willful violator, or not agreeing to the labor condition agreement are all signs for an application possibly recieving a denied status. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Wrangling\n",
    "\n",
    "   The first step to examining the data involves data wrangling or the process of converting the data into a more valuable format that can be used for analysis.  The current dataset was obtained from, https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm.  The dataset contains H1B-LCA application data from the 2017 fiscal year.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   The data wrangling for this dataset can be split into and defined by these four steps: deletion of unecessary columns, deletion of rows that contain missing values, deletion of rows with incorrect characters that do not represent the field correctly, and checking for outlier values."
