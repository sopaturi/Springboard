"594,642",British Gut,,,,,"There will be a delay in sending out British Gut orders until
    8/15.  Apologies for the inconvenience. This is a unique open collaboration between the TwinsUK team at King's College London and The
      American Gut Project (AGP) to try to understand the bacterial
    diversity of the British Gut . Many people don't realize that the bacteria that live inside us play
  an incredibly important role in our health. There are so many of them,
  that they make up 90 percent of the cells in our body and their most
  important jobs include manufacturing vitamins for us and breaking down
  and digesting our food. The trillions of bacteria in our gut weigh
  nearly 2 kg (over 4lbs). This community of bacteria can be thought of
  as an extra 'organ' which we call our ""microbiome"". We
  evolved together with our microbiome over millions of years. Recent
  research has discovered that small changes in this finely balanced
  community can affect our immune system, metabolism, body weight, mood
  and may even cause diseases such as Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
  syndrome, cancer, autoimmune disease, diabetes and heart disease. This is the first project of its kind in Europe and, with your help,
  we will be able to discover more about the crucial relationship
  between our health and our microbiome, and on a personal level, you
  will be able to discover the bacterial profile of your own gut. With
  your help, we hope to be able to answer questions such as 'How much
  does our choice of lifestyle and diet influence our microbiome, and
  can we alter our microbiome to make us healthier?' We are discovering that each person is very different and has their
  own unique microbiome. More research is needed to work out what
  constitutes a 'healthy' microbiome, and which combinations of bacteria
  should try and be avoided. In order to do this ambitious and
  much-needed project, we urgently need a large scale collection of
  human samples. Over 7 thousand people have already signed up in
  America already- but we need many more from UK Europe. The project mainly focuses on the gut as this is our main 'microbial
  home', however, the study will also look at oral, skin and (for women)
  vaginal communities as these areas of the body have problems such as
  tooth decay, gum disease, acne and infertility and may be influenced
  by the microbiome. What does it entail? First you need to sign up (see Perks on the right) and select your
  level of contribution to the project. Within three weeks, you will
  receive a kit in the mail together with detailed instructions on how
  to proceed. Shipping within the UK first class should be around £2.90,
  but we recommend taking the sample to the post office to get the
  proper postage. Getting the postage right on the first try is
  important since samples that spend a long time in transit will likely
  not produce the highest quality results. After you have returned your sample to us, the samples will be
  processed and analysed by the Knight Lab at University of California,
  San Diego and you will be provided with a list of the major groups of
  bacteria in your sample and the proportions in which they are found.
  We estimate that this will take around 3 months from the time your
  sample is scanned into our lab (but possibly longer) and once we
  provide you with your results, you will be able to see how your
  bacterial community compares to others in the study. From the diet and
  lifestyle information that you provide, we will also be able to show
  you how your results compare to other people who are within the same
  diet and lifestyle group as you (but having a very different result to
  them does not necessarily mean anything bad, it can just be that you
  have experienced slight lifestyle differences that mean that your
  bacterial profile is different). Please note that this is a scientific study, not a clinical or
      commercial project, and we will not be able to provide you with
      any clinical information/advice related to your microbiome profile. How will my sample be used? The British Gut project, like the American model, gives participants
  the opportunity to compare their personal microbiome profiles to
  family members, and other people both in the UK and abroad. Our
  project is based on the principles of 'access to all'. The data
  collected from the sample you provide will be shared anonymously both
  with participants and scientists, allowing many different scientific
  hypotheses and questions to be answered using your valuable sample. We look forward to working together on this new and exciting project.

"31,350",Rebeccas Breast Cancer Healing Journey-Please Help,U.S. Dollar,"Aug 25, 2018",of $53k goal,203,"On April 9th of 2018 my wife, best friend, and mother of our 3
    boys, Rebecca Nowak was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma ER+
    and HER2+ an aggressive form of Breast Cancer .  When we
  received the news our worlds were flipped upside down to say the
  least.  I rushed home from work to put my arms around my wife and
  process this new reality, and within an hour received a call from the
  oncologist to come in and begin a plan of action on how we would treat
  the Cancer.  Those of you that know Rebecca know that we truly believe
  in Alternative and Natural ways of Healing, so we were caught in a
  circumstance that we needed more time to process.  We began praying
  and asking God for guidance on this Journey, and to align us with the
  right people/places, and the wisdom to make whatever decision He
  wanted us to make to get Rebecca well.  After much prayer, Receiving
  ""Signs"" and doing tons of research regarding Natural
  Treatments for Cancer we decided to send my wife to an Alternative
  Cancer Center in Tijuana Mexico. (To Read The Full Story of What Led
  us to Mexico Scroll to the bottom section of this page) Since the Diagnosis, and the First trip to Mexico, we discovered that
  the Cancer has Tripled in size, Metastasized to her Lymph nodes and
  possibly her liver.  We are at a point where we need to combat this
  cancer full force but are running out of funds to do so.  Meanwhile,
  The Cancer continues to takes it's toll on Rebecca's body.  This
  morning at 4am I woke up to find my wife sobbing by my side and
  telling me that she's scared and that her whole body hurts, especially
  her liver and back.  The Cancer is growing at a pace greater than the
  treatment that we have been able to give her up to now.  We need to
  get Rebecca to Mexico for an extended stay of 3-4 weeks where she will
  be monitored constantly and given the most aggressive treatments
  possible to counteract what the Cancer is currently doing.  Some of
  the treatments will include Vitamin C, Ozone, Letrile and IUV
  therapies along with a Natural Cancer Killing Tonic, Natural Form of
  ""Chemo"" (Kills the Cancer Cells without Killing the Good
  Cells), and an Estrogen Receptor Blocker because the Cancer is
  Estrogen Fed.   The cost of Rebecca's Treatment, Testing, Scans, for
  3-4 weeks  will cost $53,000. To all of our family and friends that have taken time to read
    this, Thank you.  Please share with your family, church family and
    friends as well.  We will need your help to reach this goal. -Justin Nowak The Full Story on What led us to Mexico In November 2017 Rebecca had a Thermogram done to check for Breast
  Cancer due to a suspicious lump in her breast.  She was given a clean
  bill of health and told by the Thermographer that it was nothing to be
  concerned with and not Cancer.  We were relieved at that point and
  went on with our lives but the lump continued to increase in size. 
  Five Months Later on April 3rd we scheduled a Biopsy which confirmed
  that it was in fact Grade 3 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma ER+ and HER2+. 
  The news was devastating and we began to pray for signs and direction
  from God on what to do next.  After weeks of doing it on our own with
  a strict diet change, supplements, and cleansing the lymphatic system,
  with no real improvement, we realized that we needed to get my wife in
  the care of specialists.   Rebecca decided to call the Thermographer
  to let her know that she misdiagnosed us, she apologized and explained
  that most scan and tests are never 100% accurate and they always
  recommend a second opinion if we have concerns.  She also told Rebecca
  that she understood what she was going through because 30 years ago
  she was diagnosed with breast cancer and she beat it naturally at an
  Alternative Treatment Center in Tijuana, Mexico.  Then she proceeded
  to tell Rebecca that she had sent over 500 patients to this clinic in
  the past 15 years and they have all been healed naturally of Cancer. The following morning I was looking through unpacked boxes (We had
  just finished a move to Idaho from California when she was diagnosed)
  trying to find a power cord for the printer to print up some
  documents, with no luck.  On the 20th or so box that I cut open, I
  found a white bag with a bright yellow business card in it.  The color
  of the card caught my attention so I picked it up.  The business card
  was for the same clinic in Mexico and on the back of the card, it read
  Ogden, IA. I was in awe, so I asked my wife where
  she got this card from?  She was blown away to and had forgotten all
  about the card.  She proceeded to tell me that an older gentleman that
  used to come into her work in Iowa gave it to her and said, ""If you, or anyone that you know ever gets cancer, you
    should go to this place, they saved my life and they can save
  yours"" .  Rebecca had this card for 12 years.  It made it
  from Iowa, to 4 different homes in California and now to Idaho to be
  found within hours of hearing about this clinic for the first time
  ever from the Thermographer. Four days later, I was at a swap meet in Garden City, ID.  Within a
  few minutes of being there, I see a guy wearing a Classic Ford Bronco
  Shirt which catches my attention because I sell Classic Ford Bronco
  parts for a living and I own a Classic Ford Bronco, so I say,
  ""Hey man, I like your shirt"" After talking Trucks with him
  for a few minutes, we find out that I have sold him parts in the past
  and he knew who I was. I explained the situation to him about my wife
  and he proceeds to tell me about his mother passed from Breast
  Cancer.  When I told him that we were sending my wife to an
  Alternative Treatment Center in Mexico, his face lit up and he
  proceeds to tell me that his friends wife was battling Cancer for
  years and had been given 3 weeks to live by her
  Dr’s. They wanted to give her one more round of
  Chemo in hopes that it would help, but she refused.  With nothing else
  to lose, she decided to go to a treatment center in Mexico which ended
  up being the same Clinic that my wife and I are going to, and is alive
  and well today",https://fundrazr.com/e1Nbl6
"2,640",Help Batchy beat this battle,Australian Dollar,"Nov 6, 2018",of $8k goal,23,"I am Dani. Batchy has been a part of my
  life for over 30 years. Such a true friend who is always there. He's a
  super hard worker and anyone that knows him loves him. I'm grateful to
  have him as one of my best mates. He's always up beat and the life of
  the party but this week has really rocked him. There were no real warning signs except
  tummy pains a few weeks ago. His doctor first diagnosed anemia with a
  blood count of only 80 ( should be 140-160) Further testing with a colonoscopy found
  the malignant tumour in his bowel. This news couldn't have come at a worse
  time. He lost his job at the council 2 days before. With zero sick pay
  and holiday pay, every cost will be his responsibility and being on
  his own makes it even harder. He's too lethargic, dizzy and out of
  breath to work. His doctors have made it clear he needs to rest until
  they can operate. We will not know the full costs involved at
  this point or the ongoing expenses involved while Batchy remains out
  of work and in recovery. It depends on how the surgery goes and what
  other treatments may follow... but of course will keep you in the loop. There are MANY beautiful friends of Batchys
  out there who are asking what they can do to help!? ❤️Well this is it... No matter how big or small, every little
  bit counts. He's a tough nut our Batchy, and he's
  staying positive with all the love and strength from his family and friends. We are all here to help him and know he
  will win this battle. Thank you so for all of your messages and
  support. It means so much to him. We will keep you posted on progress as it happens. Love and light Cheers Dani",https://fundrazr.com/71NvS7
450,Help Michael see color.,U.S. Dollar,,of $450 goal,5,"WHO AM I? My name is Michael Kirk and I'm a
      pencil artist living in Pickens County Alabama.  Many people know
      of my work, but most of them don't know that I draw in black and
      white because I have trouble seeing color.  I have a condition
      known as anomalous trichormacy, which is a fancy way of saying I
      am not totally colorblind, seeing the world in black and white,
      but, rather, I'm color deficient.  My specific condition is known
      as Deuteranomaly or ""weak green"" vision. People like me refer to our type of
      colorblindness as ""color confusion"" because that most
      accurately describes what it is.  Even though I can't see green
      like I should, it affects my other colors as you can see in the
      simulated image below: Seeing the world this way creates some
    frustration from time to time.  Purples can look blue.  Greens can
    look brown.  Even a red stop sign can blend in with the green trees
    behind it and trying to tell which traffic light is illuminated can
    be an outright guess in certain lighting conditions. One of my first artistic experiments was
    with colorizing old black and white photos.  I knew I could be a
    little confused by colors, but at the time I had no idea I had a
    type of color deficiency and bravely colored a few photos, trying to
    be as accurate as I could.  When I showed them off, people told me I
    had chosen a pink that was much too bright for someone's lips or
    that I had chosen a bright green instead of yellow.  I haven't
    recolored any photos since then because I was embarrassed to make so
    many mistakes. I later learned I was truly
    colorblind while browsing t-shirts on the Internet one day.  I found
    a picture of a shirt with a bunch of differently colored green
    circles on it, but I didn't get why it was supposed to be funny. 
    Upon reading the comments, I learned that it was styled after
    an Ishihara test and that normal people could read the caption: 
     ""F*** the Color Blind.""  I was unable to read it.  :( After that harsh revelation, I decided to
    test myself and found some real Ishihara test patterns to confirm my
    fears.  Yes.  I was color blind.  In a way I was disappointed, but
    at the same time relieved to finally have an explanation why I got
    so confused by color.  I wasn't dumb.  It wasn't because I didn't
    pay enough attention.  It wasn't my nearsightedness or glasses.  I
    just couldn't see color like everyone else.  It was vindication.  It
    was closure.  And I accepted it (I had no choice). Back when I first learned I was
      color blind/color deficient, there was not much anyone could do
      about it, but then I saw a video on FaceBook of a color blind man
      seeing the color of his children's eyes for the first time and I
      was fascinated.  His family had given him a pair of, what appeared
      to be sunglasses, as a gift and he could see new colors with
      them.  What he saw moved him to tears.  I wanted to see color like
      that!  Itching to know more, I researched the video and that was
      when I first learned about Enchroma glasses. WHAT IS ENCHROMA? Over 300 million people worldwide are affected by red-green color
  vision deficiency, also called color blindness. Enchroma has created
  glasses which enhance color vision without the compromise of color
  accuracy. Enchroma glasses are an optical assistive device; they are not
      a cure for color blindness. Results vary depending on the type and
      extent of color vision deficiency per individual. The glasses are
      estimated to be effective for 4 out of 5 cases (80%) of red-green
      color vision deficiency – prospective users are encouraged to take
      our online color vision test to assess the likelihood of efficacy. Enchroma does not
      endorse use of the glasses to pass occupational screening tests
      such as the Ishihara test. For more information please read the FAQs , learn about the Enchroma technology and story , or contact customer support . Check out these reactions WHY I NEED YOUR HELP. Because Enchroma glasses are new to
    the market and because of my nearsightedness (I have to order a
    custom prescription), I cannot afford the cost to get my own pair
    easily.  A basic pair costs $350 or more (depending on frame
    type/model) and a prescription fee is $150. If enough people help me get the
    frames I want, I can cover the prescription fee.  I appreciate you
    taking the time to read all the way down here to the bottom.  I hope
    to reach my goal before Autumn or Christmas so I can see all the
    different colors of the trees and the decorations of the holiday season. Thank you for your time.  :)",https://fundrazr.com/d1Nhaf
765,Top Surgery Support Fund for Nate,Canadian Dollar,"Sep 16, 2018",of $3k goal,15,"Hi! My name is Katie and I am creating this fundraiser to support our
  friend and community member, Nate. As some of you may know, our dear friend Nate is having top surgery
  on September 13, 2018. Top surgery is a gender-affirming procedure
  that many trans folks like Nate undergo in order to live life in a
  more comfortable, accessible way.  Nate has been on waiting lists for
  this surgery for over 5 years and he has been binding for 12 years for
  anywhere from 12 - 16 hours per day. This daily binding has taken a
  toll on his body and this surgery will greatly improve Nate's quality
  of life and the ease with which he moves through the world. As a
  community, we have an opportunity to come together to support Nate
  during this exciting and challenging time by helping him to pay for
  surgery and supporting him during his recovery time. HOW WILL THE MONEY BE USED? 1) While OHIP covers much of the cost of this surgery, there is a
  cost of $2,360 that is not covered by OHIP. We hope to raise at least
  this much money so that Nate can focus on recovery and does not have
  the burden of this surgery cost weighing on him. 2) It would be absolutely wonderful if we could raise some money to
  support Nate's costs of living and healing process while he is off
  work after his surgery. As most of Nate's friends and community know,
  he works as a baker (and is darn amazing at it!). While baking is one
  of Nate's great passions, it is also a very physically demanding job
  and will require Nate to be off of work for 8 - 12 weeks-- much longer
  than if he had a less physical job. Any money raised over and above
  the initial goal of $2,360 will go directly to supporting Nate's
  recovery. No amount is too little to donate, even if it is only a few dollars! WHAT IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO DONATE? It's totally okay if you aren't able to donate right now! Here are
  some other ways you can help Nate: 1) SHARE THIS FUNDRAISER! Let's get the word out there by sharing
  this fundraiser on social media - give your friends and community the
  opportunity to help out by sharing this campaign. 2) Consider creative ways that you could contribute. For example,
  maybe you don't have the cash, but maybe you work somewhere that would
  be cool with you putting out a donation jar! 3) Offer tangible support. You can reach out to Nate's partner Tanya
  at smithsalter -at- gmail -dot- com to arrange tangible support. For
  example: running errands, dropping off food, dog walking, garden help,
  etc. while Nate recovers. 3) Support The Feral Knot on Etsy and beyond! Nate's partner, Tanya, has a
  (super amazing) small business creating macrame art, rustic woodwork,
  healing plants, and facilitating macrame workshops. You can support
  The Feral Knot by liking the page on Facebook / Instagram , sharing, and as the holidays approach,
  consider supporting Nate and Tanya by supporting The Feral Knot. 4) Reach out to Nate for social get-togethers beginning 1- 2 weeks
  after surgery! Nate will be recovering for 8 - 12 weeks, and after the
  initial post-surgery period, he will appreciate friends reaching out
  for low-key coffee, picnics, and hang outs. Anyone who knows and has shared space with Nate knows that he is an
  incredible, generous, and caring human being. Nate deserves all of the
  support in the world, and I am confident that we can help to ease some
  of the financial burden that comes with surgery and post-surgery healing. WANT TO LEARN MORE? Feeling confused about top surgery, recovery times, and all of this
  other stuff? Here are some great resources about top surgery and what
  is needed for healing: https://www.healthline.com/health/transgender/top-surgery#recovery",https://fundrazr.com/natestopsurgery
"1,189",Help Nadia pay for gender affirming surgeries,Euro,"Sep 26, 2018",of €4k goal,29,"Hi there. My name is Nadia . I'm a neurodiverse
  transgender woman of color living The Netherlands. I was assigned male at birth, but for most of my life, especially
  since I started puberty I've been suffering from crippling dysphoria regarding my gender. Along with my ADHD , this led to me developing chronic
    depression, anxiety and agoraphobia in my late teens and
  young adulthood. Eventually I couldn't take it any more and realized
  that the only way I could ever be truly happy is to transition and start living as my most authentic self. I’ve lived in this body for 31 years, of which only the last 3 I've
  been on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) . This,
  along with things like permanent laser facial hair
  removal has gone a long way towards helping me look and feel
  like the woman I know I am. But there's only so much that hormones can
  do. It can't fix the parts of my body that cause me the most
  dysphoria. Only surgery can change those. When I first started transition, I didnt want to rush into any
  surgeries. After all, they're scary, permanent, invasive and very
  expensive. I was hoping HRT alone would be enough. But over the past 3
  years the pain I feel regarding these specific aspects of my body has
  been constant and persistent regardless of how much
  self love I try to practice. It’s not something that’s just
    going to go away on its own. Deciding on getting these procedures isn't a decision I made lightly.
  It came after years of deliberation and trying everything else I could
  think of to make this feeling go away. Over the past 9 months especially, my mental health has gone down the
  drain. A lot of the time I'm too scared to go outside by myself,
  because how transphobic society can be to someone like me. My loved
  ones, family members, and partners have noticed how much worse I've
  gotten. I've been feeling hopeless, gross and most of all stuck. Like
  I'm unable to move forward in any way. Just like my decision to come out and transition, the decision to get
  rid of my facial hair using laser hair removal, the decision to go on
  HRT, having these surgeries really is the best
  option. It’s the next step I need to take in my transition. Please consider donating if you’re able to. It would mean
      the world to me and you’d be helping me out in a big way. If
      you’re unable to donate please share the link as much as possible. Thank you. <3",https://fundrazr.com/helpnadia
"4,850",Steve Roberts: Cancer Treatment Appeal,Pound Sterling,"Aug 21, 2018",of £7.5k goal,83,"My dear friend Steve Roberts has just been diagnosed with cancer in
  his prostate. I'm fundraising to help him and his wife Susanna afford
  the inpatient treatment he's been offered at the end of July at the
  Camphill Wellbeing Trust Medical Centre in Aberdeen and its follow-up
  maintenance programme. This intensive protocol is widely used in
  Europe and will double his chances of a good recovery by boosting his
  immune system as well as targeting the cancer cells. Donations of any
  size are vitally needed and will be much appreciated. Thank you! In most men, prostate cancer is slow growing and merely kept under
  observation but Steve's has an aggressive element that needs treatment
  to stop it spreading. The Gleason Score grades prostate cancers on a
  scale of 2-10 and his MRI and recent biopsy results reveal a Grade 7
  tumour. It is currently localised and Stage 2. As his beloved wife
  Susanna lost both her father and her mother to cancer they're
  determined to maximise Steve's chances by using conventional and complementary medicine this time. The intensive Mistletoe protocol at CWT Aberdeen is a holistic,
  plant-based, whole-person approach which, in our opinion and according
  to research and scientific evidence, strengthens the immune system and
  the life force while directly tackling the tumour. We believe it will
  give him the best chance of surviving this disease and retaining a
  good quality of life. When I met with Steve and Susanna last Summer at Emerson College,
  Forest Row (below) we were pleased to find each other looking so well. Steve had only just
  retired the previous December. His five-decade long working life was
  split equally between the written word (as a journalist, book &
  magazine publisher, editor and book seller) and curative education
  (first as a Carer and House Father in residential homes at Hohepa, New
  Zealand and Bristol, then as a teacher, Letter Press  tutor,
  Administrator and Trustee in special needs education). He and I met
  when we worked together in staff development for Ruskin Mill Trust at
  their Freeman College site in Sheffield, but he seems twice as busy in retirement. Steve is now on the verge of completing his first book - about
  Creativity and the Writer's Muse - with a second one planned (on
  William Golding and the double) while simultaneously organising an
  international conference on Nature Spirits, Elemental Beings and
    Human Cooperation scheduled for May 2019, and giving public
  talks and workshops on a variety of subjects. You will probably remember this fizzy
    combination of positivity, energy, enthusiasm and wide-ranging
    curiosity from your own dealings with him! Please help me to help this husband, brother, stepfather,
    larger-than-life Kiwi and inspiring friend to very many people
    around the world get on with the job of living his life to the full
    while trying to improve it for others. Every single penny donated will be spent
  on Steve's inpatient treatment in July, his ongoing home injection
  maintenance programme and his recovery. Your positive thoughts, prayers and messages of support are
      equally valuable. Steve's email is steveroberts1151@gmail.com . He is currently feeling fine and is his
  usual cheerful self. Thank you very much. With every good wish, Alan Miggin",https://fundrazr.com/SteveRobertsAppeal
"5,430",Hannah's Heroes,U.S. Dollar,,of $177k goal,116,"Our daughter Hannah was born with 2 very rare diseases 1 called C.A.H
  and the other called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which works to rob her
  of her ability to move, breath and, eventually, live. There is a drug
  that can stop this disease. It has just approved it. But accessing it
  costs $177,000, and the process of our drug plan won’t be ready for
  another year. That’s a year that our little girl can’t afford to wait.
  It would be a year of vulnerability and loss. But with your
  help, we believe we can turn it into a year of miracles! Let me
  tell you the rest of our story. Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) has
  become our daily life. It’s the genetic condition most likely to kill
  children under six years of age, and our daughter has it. It’s a
  progressive lower motor neuron disease, that is loosely paralleled to
  adult ALS. But there are significant differences: most notably, SMA
  never affects cognition, so our daughter is as bright and keen as any
  other child her age. At 14 months, Hannah took her first 3 steps. She has never walked
  since then. After those first steps, she lost any strength to walk,
  then strength to pull up to stand, and then the strength to crawl. She
  can barely get from a lying position to a sitting position. Hannah is
  our mature little scholar! But she is completely dependant on us for
  dressing, toileting, and getting her in her wheelchair.But those
  things aren’t the worst. She is at an extreme risk of respiratory
  failure. Every single simple cold/viral infection is a threat. At
  least three times a year these infections strike hard enough to send
  her to the hospital. As a parent, I weep and get nauseous just
  thinking about this. I don’t want to think about what the next year
  could hold for her. But the amazing thing is that it doesn’t have
  to be that kind of year for our little girl. For over two decades
  the gene responsible for SMA has been known but there has not been a
  single available treatment. This past summer the first drug in history
  to specifically treat SMA was approved ! It is called Spinraza
  (Nusinersen). It can completely halt SMA in its path and even lead to
  some GAIN in muscle strength! This drug truly is a miracle, and
  we need our daughter on it as soon as possible. Though it’s
  approved Spinraza won’t be available on our drug plans for another
  year. It costs $177,000 to provide a year’s supply for Hannah 3 vials
  . The manufacturer, Biogen, will sell it directly to families willing
  to pay for it. This treatment WILL stop Hannah's respiratory deterioration, keep her
  hands strong, and prevent future problems in her spine that would
  require surgery.And we don’t even know what gains it might provide.
  Instead of a year of atrophy it can become a year of miracles! But we
  need your help. We do everything we can for our little girl but we
  can’t do this alone. We need to raise $177,000. Please join us
  on our journey and help to make this a year of miracles for Hannah",https://fundrazr.com/HannahsHeroes

"1,620",Luke Has Something to Get Off Their Chest,U.S. Dollar,,of $9.1k goal,15,"Let's be real, asking for money is no fun, even though I come at it
  with a lot of privilege. I wish I didn't have to disclose information
  about my gender dysphoria and healthcare decisions to a public
  audience. I wish I could just tell you all the other awesome places
  ways you could use your money, and most of all I wish that we didn't
  live in a culture where healthcare feels so unattainable for so many
  people. But the truth is, this is really important to me, and I think
  will make a big difference in my life. Top surgery is something that
  has felt out of the question for me for the past 14 years due to
  various health issues. I now feel like it is a real possibility, and I
  feel more clear than ever that it's what I want. The biggest roadblock
  still in my way is the money. So I'm here asking you for support,
  because raising money is actually way more doable than solving a lot
  of other problems in the world! And I'm so grateful and honored to
  have a community that can be part of this process with me. Here's how the estimated costs break down for the procedure and the 2
  to 6 weeks of recovery required: $8250 - the surgery itself and hospital fees $800 - the
  equivalent of 6 weeks' missed rental income to pay my bills, since I
  won't be able to rent out my guest room during my recovery (in
  addition to taking the time off of my job, which I may or may not have
  enough PTO for) Experiencing life in a body that feels like mine: priceless! Another way you can help right now: share my photography page,
  lukehirst.com. I'm using that as a way to raise money for surgery, too. Thank you in advance!!",https://fundrazr.com/lukehirst

  it reaches the better! I am reaching out to all of you in need of assistance in paying
  medical bills. Not sure how many of you have heard, but I recently underwent
  emergency colon surgery. I went to the local hospital and they had to immediately transfer me
  to a bigger hospital for emergency surgery.  I was informed that if I
  had not came in exactly when I did, that I more than likely would have
  died that night in my sleep. As I'm sure you know, that scared me and I started thanking God that
  I got there when I did. While I am very thankful to be alive and hopefully healed up
  eventually, I now have a few large medical bills I was not expecting
  to have and am not sure how I will afford as I recently retired from
  truck driving after over 20 yrs. So again, I am reaching out to any and all of my friends and friends
  of friends to please help me out. I know everyone is in need of help at one time or another, and for
  people that know me, they know I am the first one to offer help when I
  am able. I am not used to needing to ask for help, so I am out of my territory

    I am asking you for help on her behalf. As some of you may already
    know, Shelby, a two-time liver transplant recipient, has just found
    out that her current liver is in a late stage of chronic rejection.
    She is going to need another liver transplant in the near future and
    she is already in late stage liver cirrhosis. Over the past few years, Shelby has been suffering terribly from
    other health issues as well. Shelby developed Atypical Trigeminal
    Neuralgia which is a chronic pain condition that affects the
    trigeminal nerve, which carries sensation from your face to your
    brain. Her Atypical Trigeminal Neuralgia (ATN) has progressed to the
    point where she suffers from more frequent bouts of searing pain
    forcing her to significantly cut back on her jewelry designs. Shelby
    has been in and out of pain clinics and hospital for surgeries to
    try and help with the pain for over a year. Her most recent surgery
    for this was in early June 2018 and more will be needed to control
    the facial nerve pain that she refers to as “an ice cream head ache
    that just doesn’t ever go away”. Shelby is a fighter and no one would know by looking at her that
    she was suffering from severe chronic pain or in need of another
    transplant. Knowing the state of her liver, she just won 4 medals at
    the Canadian Transplant Games last month in swimming. She is a strong, motivated, and the most compassionate woman
    you’ll meet who needs our help to show her she is supported in this
    next journey she has to go through. She will never ask for it, so I
    will for her… I am asking you all to help raise $20,000 for Shelby’s
    upcoming medical expenses, prescriptions, bills, hospital parking,
    gas money to VGH, after-transplant care, post-transplant
    accommodations, and more as she prepares for this next medical
    hurdle. Financial worry should not be something she has to stress
    over during this time. She needs to focus on her health and getting
    a new liver. I know Shelby will be more than grateful and so will I. Together
    we can all make this easier for her and ultimately help save her life. (Photo Credits: David Fournier, Scott Gielen, Gerard Gielen,

"6,338",Zach Branson's Medical Fundraiser,U.S. Dollar,,of $15k goal,46,"Zachary Branson was born with a liver disease known as biliary
  atresia. The main procedure that was performed is known as a Kasai
  portoenterostomy. This operation connects the bile drainage from the
  liver directly to the intestinal tract. Success of this procedure may
  be improved when it is done before an infant is 8 weeks old. The Kasai
  procedure is helpful because it permits bile to flow and can allow a
  child to grow and remain in fairly good health for many years. It is
  important to understand that this surgery is typically a treatment for
  and not cure of biliary atresia. Ongoing liver disease is likely to
  continue to occur even with a successful operation. Up to 80 percent
  of children who undergo the Kasai portoenterostomy will eventually
  need to have a liver transplant. Doctors warned that Zach would not
  live past the age of 2 years old. Now at 30 years old, Zach has
  surprised the medical community. He has gone through quite rough times
  in his life growing up with this disease. His mother passed away in
  2006 from liver and kidney failure due to alcoholism. Zach cannot work
  a ""normal"" job anymore due to complications that arise from
  this disease. He is currently in the process of fighting for
  disability. The application status is pending. We are asking to share
  this page with everyone you know. Encourage your loved ones and
  friends to become an organ and tissue donor. If you have been blessed
  enough in life to allow yourself to make a donation to this brave,

He has always talked about finding a way to allow him to see the beauty in the every day world and I think I have found a solution~ Enchroma Glasses! I have desperatly been trying to save up the money to purchase him a pair, but sadly something always seems to come up preventing me from doing so. You see, he is an incredibly hard working man who is always working to provide for our family. He deserves this so much and it breaks my heart to see him get frustrated when someone asks him to retrieve an item of certain color and he struggles to find it. Recently, we had a gender reveal for our son who is coming into this world sometime during September 2018. We had a balloon filled with blue confetti, and when the balloon popped Austin thought the confetti was pink until I whispered in his ear that he was indeed getting his baby boy. I want nothing more then to be able to purchase him a pair. I have said nothing to him of what I'm trying to do, so this will be a complete surprise!

  battling cancer and its recurrence. She survived her thyroid surgery
  and radioactive iodine therapy. Years later, unfortunately, she was
  diagnosed with a rare radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated
  thyroid cancer after failing to respond to radiation therapy and the
  chemo drug Sorafenib. Her cancer has then, metastasized to the brain,
  bones and lungs. It is now a battle against time to prevent further
  progression of her disease. As of this writing, she had been undergoing radiation treatment but
  her doctors prescribed another round of chemotherapy thereafter using
  a drug called Lenvima. Due to the very high cost of this medicine, the
  Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office is providing 70,000 Php worth of
  subsidy per month for 5 months. However, this is not enough as her
  medication for a month would cost 208,620 PhP (3,900 USD / 433,600 JPY). Our mom is currently confined in the Veterans Memorial Medical Center
  for almost a month now and the growing medical bill is already taking
  a toll in our family’s limited financial resources. Hence, we are
  asking all our friends, relatives, and kind-hearted people to help us
  raise funds to cover our mother’s medical expenses so that we can
  bring her home again to spend more time with her. If you or anyone you know could please find it in your heart to help
  our family in any way you can, whether through prayers or through
  financial support, no matter how small, for our pending medical
  expenses, your generosity would be sincerely appreciated. We would

    but numerous side jobs. He was a mechanic and
    painter a nd his main career was for 30+years as a
    Manager and District Manager in the Grocery field. In September 2015 his life was changed forever. As he was
    closing at his new job for the night, two armed men came in and
    robbed the store. He was beaten for over 20 minutes against the safe
    and with the handgun. Michael has had both knees operated on due to
    being slammed to the floor numerous times. He now has black out
    seizures, some are in the brain and many of the seizures are Grand
    Mal. In April of this year I came home to find him in a continual
    seizure episode. He was hospitilized and in ICU. His hospital stay
    ran for a week and I lost income due to having to stay with him. His
    diagnosis is TBI, PTSD and 80% loss of hearing on his left side (we
    are awaiting surgery on that issue); he will never be able to work
    according to his Doctors and he is unable to drive so, we have to

    go for needed items. We have applied for his SSD but they are in the
    hearing stage which can be another 18 months. We have monthly
    expenses for monitors to keep him safe, and the loss of his income
    has left us with no savings and behind on bills. We have filed for
    everything under the sun but we are still waiting, with no end in
    sight. Our needs are to pay his medical bills, maintain payment on
    his fall detection monitor, get him a new cane and pay for the

"11,920",URGENTLY NEEDED New Hips for Christian McCudden!!,Australian Dollar,"Aug 24, 2018",of $81k goal,24,"Hi, my wife and I have been friends with Christian and Melissa for nearly
    twenty years... it has been many years since we have caught up with
    this wonderful family and after a recent phone conversation with
    Christian we have only just now learned of the ongoing physical
    hardship he has been going through over the years and the very
    difficult decision he has just had to make..... After our chat I thought there has to be something we can do to
    help, so I have setup this campaign in the hope that you will all
    join us in standing together to make a massive difference to
    Christian’s upcoming journey! Following is a snapshot of the McCudden family and Christian’s
    journey so far and the reasons why our donations are so very vital
    and impactful at this time for them... Christian has been married to Melissa for 21 yrs. and they have
    3 three amazing children, Noah, Ella and Zachary. In 2013 Christian & Melissa moved from their home in
    Sydney's northern beaches leaving family, friends and working at C3
    Oxford falls as one of the full time pastors, and planted C3 church
    Noosa, launching in May of 2013. Prior to planting C3 Noosa they were a part of C3 Oxford falls
    for 20 years. Over that time Christian fulfilled many roles in various
  areas including: Youth ministry for 12yrs / Pastoring / Lecturing in the Bible College. Travelled with and assisted Ps Phil for 6 years. Project managed the buildings and renovations that went on over the
  years at C3 Oxford falls. Christian has also over many years ministered in Church's throughout
  Australia, New Zealand, America, Europe, Asia and Indonesia seeing
  many people saved, healed and touched by the power of God. He has also seen over the year’s incredible healings and testimonies. Blind eyes opened / Deaf ears opened / Cancer healed Crippled people getting out of wheel chairs / Stroke patients healed
  and walking and speaking. Pain leaving bodies immediately / Blood conditions healed / People
  who were suicidal set free Dead raised to life / Arthritis conditions healed Broken bones healed instantly… and many more stories to be told. Christian and Melissa have now been on the Sunshine Coast QLD for 5
  1/2 years with C3 Noosa just celebrating its 5th birthday.  A church
  that is vibrant, growing, and impacting many lives in their local
  community and beyond. As this all still continues to grow and function
  Christian currently works part time for their church C3 Noosa and full
  time as a carpenter, building on job sites. Over the past 8 years Christian has
    suffered with pain in his body from a gradual degenerative arthritic
    condition in both his hips. In the past 4 years the pain has become
    very intense with major side effects such as only being able to
    sleep a couple of sound hours a night, having limited movement,
    unable to exercise or do the physical things he loves to do and
    especially with his kids. Two years ago Christian had the
    opportunity to go over to the U.S to get stem cell treatment in both
    hips which has helped to a small degree but has not been able to see
    the full benefits due to his current working activity of being on
    the tools building. Building over the last few years
      has taken a huge toll on his body and made the pain more intense.
      Christian has now come to a place where he cannot physically
      continue to do his work labouring as a builder, due to the extreme
      pain and limited movement. He has no other option left other than to proceed with
      further treatment being a double hip replacement! A double hip replacement and the extensive rehabilitation
        involved is quite costly and the road to full recovery is a good
        6 to12 months! In a matter of days Christian will have no income from building as he has had to give notice and quit due to his bodies inability
    to function sufficiently in the way needed to perform his role as a
    builder and his bodies pain levels have reached a crippling level. Christian needs our help NOW! The results from this will be amazing! It will give Christian back his quality of life! It will give
      him back the things that we take for granted like having a full
      night’s sleep, having no crippling pain, being able to exercise,
      and the ability to do normal life activities with his children
      while they are still young! We would love to enable Christian to get this surgery done ASAP
      and for him to have the appropriate time required for a full recovery. It is a costly procedure and the post-operative rehabilitation
      expenses required will be quite high. To enable Christian to have the procedure and the necessary
        time off not needing to labour physically in the building
        industry is a minimum of six months..... So that’s what we have
        based the amount of funds needed to raise on: - The double hip
        replacement surgery, rehabilitation and physical therapy for six
        months and funds to keep the family afloat while Christian is
        unable to work. So we kindly ask you to consider donating to help bless
        Christian and his family at this time as they make plans towards
        treatment, surgery and rehabilitation. Christian has been such a faithful servant and blessing to so
      many lives over the years. A servant’s heart through and through
      and one of the most generous people you will ever meet. If you are reading this then you have probably been blessed in
        some form either directly or indirectly from the big hearted
        kindness of this faithful man. We now we get the opportunity to sow back into this rich soil of
    an amazing family and help them in their time of need! They are so humble and never complain most people wouldn’t even
      know about this ongoing struggle over the years and how Christian
      has been enduring such pain in his body while going about blessing others! Let’s all band together to quickly raise the funds for this
        much needed surgery! If we all dig deep, give what we can and pass this on to our
        various friends and networks then Christian will be on the road
        to recovery before we know it... Thank you all for your thoughts, prayers and generous donations.... God Bless!!",https://fundrazr.com/f1MWCb
"3,180",Please help Maria beat Syringomyelia,Canadian Dollar,,of $10k goal,41,"My family and I have made this campaign in the hopes of not
    only receiving support but to also gain awareness for a supposedly
    ""rare"" disease. Since I was diagnosed, I have gotten in
    touch with patients from all over the world who have the same
    condition, and most people are misdiagnosed, or their symptoms are
    disregarded for years (as was my case). Creating awareness is so
    important to help others recognize signs and get proper treatment in
    time. Thank you for checking out my campaign, and I would be so
    grateful for your contribution! Have you ever heard of Arnold Chiari Syndrome and
    Syringomyelia? Probably not; I had no idea what it was until I was diagnosed in 2016! In my best efforts to sum it up, I have a malformation in the base of
  my skull that compresses my cerebellum and medulla. As a result,
  cerebral fluid is trapped inside my spinal cord, which is slowly
  killing off nerves that are vital for my organs and extremities to
  function properly. What are the symptoms and repercussions? The most severe outcome is tetraplegia. There are many symptoms, but
  some are chronic neck and back pain, loss of muscle strength, vertigo,
  migraines, partial or total paralysis of my arms, legs and torso. At
  the moment, I have already lost sensitivity to heat or cold (I can
  burn myself easily), am losing reflexes in my arms and legs, motor
  control and strength, and I live in constant neck and back pain, let
  alone face annoying headaches. Surgery needs to be done as soon as
  possible to prevent my symptoms from getting worse before it is too late. Is there a cure or treatment? Apparently, there is no cure. However, its progression can be
  controlled or even reversed through a surgery that consists of cutting
  the Filum Terminale - a ligament that connects the spinal cord and spine. The CHIARI Institute located in Barcelona is the pioneer of this
  minimally invasive surgical procedure. I went to Spain in May with my
  parents for a consultation, and fortunately, their surgical team
  confirmed that I am a candidate for treatment! The cost of the surgery
  abroad is very expensive (approx $44,000), however, I have been lucky
  enough to find a neurosurgeon in Brazil who is offering the same
  treatment. Unfortunately, this surgery is not offered in Canada. The second and most common treatment in attempts to control the
  disease is decompressive craniectomy brain surgery. I faced this
  high-risk and extremely painful surgery in 2016, but unfortunately, my
  symptoms have continued to progress. For more information on Chiari and Syringomyelia and its treatment,

"14,465",Drew’s leukemia fight,U.S. Dollar,,of $20k goal,138,"Drew Aufderheide was diagnosed with a rare and incurable form of
  Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) .  Only 5,000 per year in the United
  States are diagnosed with this disease and because the cancer is
  caused by a chromosomal change, there is no way to cure it - only
  medication to keep it at bay.  At the age of 33, it is extremely rare
  for someone like Drew to have this form of leukemia.  It is normally
  diagnosed in people with an average age of 67, and the life expectancy
  is approximately 15 years. There are currently a lot of unknown facts
  surrounding Drew's case because physicians and oncologists do not
  often see CML in someone so young and because of Drew's young age, his
  life expectancy is unknown. What is known, is that Drew needs to take a maintenance chemo
  drug/pill each day to manage the CML for the rest of his life, or
  until a cure is discovered.  There are only a few drugs available at
  this time to treat this disease and Drew's body has already rejected
  3.  He is on the last and 4th drug that is available at this time and
  because it is so rare the demand for the drug is low.  The medication
  he is on now comes from Switzerland, the only place it is made.  The
  doctor orders it through a lab in New Jersey, it is then
  mailed directly to Drew. This medication is not available through a pharmacy. Because of the low demand, the cost for Drew's medication is
  approximately $11,000 per/month.  Medical Insurance and grants pay a
  portion of the entire cost of the drug, so Drew is faced with finding
  funding to make up the balance.  This disease has been an incredible
  financial strain on Drew and his wife Val. With this medication comes
  side effects that he must manage.  Drew has met this challenge with
  his usual strength of determination, peace of soul, his faith in God
  and warm and loving demeanor. Drew is very grateful for the prayers and financial support people
  have shown him in the past.  Financially, the importance of any
  monetary gifts cannot be overstated.  It has allowed him to pay for
  the medication to keep him alive.  From a faith viewpoint, he cannot
  thank you all enough for your prayers.  He knows from experience that
  prayer works.  During this last year when weeks of side effects have
  kept him in bed unable to work, he felt your love and prayers.",https://fundrazr.com/exjqd
"34,760",Help Victor Beat MS with Stem Cell Transplantation,Canadian Dollar,,of $40k goal,181,"Hello, We are a group of Victor's family and friends and we are trying to
  help him raise funds to finance a trip overseas, to attend a medical
  centre that specializes in Stem Cell Treatments. The exact centre and
  the exact treatment are yet to be determined.This will depend on the
  amount of funds raised. There are many variables involved in this type
  of treatment, each with their own respective cost. An example would
  be, an Autologous  transplant (collecting a patient's own
  blood-forming stem cells), versus an Allogeneic transplant (collecting
  stem cells from a matching donor). Fortunately, it's a very hopeful
  time for people suffering from Multiple Sclerosis and other
  Auto-Immune diseases. There have been many success stories (some of
  which you can view on YouTube). This type of treatment is becoming
  mainstream in many countries around the world. Sadly for Victor,
  Canada is still in its developmental stage. Please take a moment and read a little bit about Victor's life and
  his battle with MS. If you can financially manage a small donation, it
  would be truly appreciated. A donation can be made right from this
  page. Victor will receive 95% of the funds, and this wonderful website
  will receive 5%. Whether you can donate or not, please be so kind as
  to pass this page along, via email or social media, to as many people
  as you can.  We thank you and are grateful for your support. Most of you visiting this fundraising page already know Victor, but
  for those of you who don't please let me introduce him. Victor is 59
  years old and has been fighting an uphill battle with Multiple
  Sclerosis for 26 years. It has been quite a battle but he has always
  fought with courage and grace.  Victor first felt the symptoms of MS
  shortly after completing his first and only triathlon.  Soon after
  that race, he was eager to begin training in hopes of improving upon
  his time in the next race. It was then that the symptoms hit him, and
  they had an immediate and devastating effect.  He went from running 17
  miles a day to not being able to run one block. In 1984, just after completing college, Victor found employment with
  the CIBC in the Savings Application Department as a Programmer. Two
  years later he transferred to Host Facilities as a Programmer.  His
  talents were recognized  and he was promoted to manage a group of 7
  programmers. His team was the infrastructure and the bank's
  applications ran on their software. Victor was prepared to leave the bank due to his MS in 1999 when the
  logistics of getting to work became difficult, but in the year 2000,
  (potential Y2K crisis) he stayed on to ensure all applications ran
  smoothly. Victor left his managerial position shortly after this
  period and is now supported, in part, by longterm disability benefits. In 2010, Victor, his wife Michelle and his brother Tony, all went to
  Egypt to have the CCSVI (Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency) -
  Liberation treatment.  As you can imagine it was a quite an expensive
  endeavor. The physical benefits Victor experienced were remarkable but
  some affects were short lived. At that point, in 2010, Victor hadn't
  been able to move his right leg for many years. Amazingly, just a few
  hours after doctors placed catheters and balloon inflation into his
  collapsed and blocked veins, Victor was able to raise that same leg
  into the air.  When he returned home we could all see improvement and
  thought he was on his way to recovery.  Even his horrific Trigeminal
  Neuralgia pain was greatly reduced. Trigeminal Neuralgia
    is considered to be one of the most painful afflictions known.
    It is characterized by episodes of excruciating stabbing or
    electrical shock-like pains which hit one side of the face. The
    episodes of pain usually last up to two minutes and may occur
    spontaneously or be triggered by light stimulation. Victor has
    endured this affliction daily for over a decade. The CCSVI results lasted for approximately one year.  We believe the
  vein in his neck collapsed and became blocked once more. Due to the
  delicate nature of veins (as opposed to arteries), stents cannot be
  used. There is a risk of the stent becoming dislodged, migrating along
  the blood vessels and becoming lodged in the heart or lungs. Prior to the MS, Victor lived a very healthy lifestyle and continues
  to do so today. Beginning day one, Victor has not benefitted with any
  traditional medicine for his symptoms. In fact all prescribed options
  to manage pain only exacerbated his leg weakness. Research has since
  determined that as varied as MS symptoms may present so too are the
  outcomes with medication for Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.
  To support his wellness, Victor employs various holistic forms. Some
  of the modalities include: Hyperbaric Oxygen treatments; Live Blood
  Cell Analysis; Reichian therapy; Homeopathy; Naturopathic Medicine; as
  well as following a strict diet and supplement regime. The financial
  impact has been staggering, but Victor attributes his longevity to
  these natural treatments. The driving force that gives Victor strength to endure this battle is
  his love for his family; his wife Michelle, daughter Simone, and son
  Kristian. He once stated to me that if he were able to go back in
  time, he would gladly suffer MS again if it meant he could spend his
  life with Michelle, and participate fully with their children while
  they strive to achieve their own personal and professional
  aspirations.  Victor is proud that both Simone and Kristian are
  excelling in university with a shared goal to positively impact
  healthcare for others. In the bottom left-hand corner of the above profile photo, there is a
  link to additional photos. Please feel free to have a glimpse at the
  amazing life Victor has lived, and is living. We, Victor's friends and family, thank you!",https://fundrazr.com/fundvictor

630,Skirts With A Cause,U.S. Dollar,,of $3.5k goal,5,"Hi, my name is Jacquelyn Davis. Welcome to Skirts With a Cause! I’ve started a Fundrazr making skirts in exchange for donations to
  save my quality of life. I’m a 26-year-old woman from Birmingham,
  Alabama and I have been diagnosed with a serious disease called
      Paraneoplastic (pre-cancerous) Limbic (affecting the nervous
      system) encephalitis (meaning swelling in the
  brain) . Sewing is a great passion of mine, which I use as a distraction
  during episodes of pain. Sometimes I sew to shake off jitters between cancer medications and
  doctors’ appointments. Mostly though, I sew because I enjoy it. A day for me is like a rollercoaster full of healthy moments and
    cognitive challenges. I can have intense spasms, trouble speaking,
    but other times I can be more eloquent like in my video. Having
    Limbic Encephalitis is similar to having half a brain. My head hurts
    and my body freaks out constantly. Sometimes I feel like a blender,
    sometimes a little better, but never like myself. I have been forced to leave college, and much of a regular life,
      to take care of my health fulltime. At this point, I
  am in a tough transition without private insurance. While t here is no cure , certain therapies have
  helped me. I believe I can get better. I want to get better and be as
    healthy as possible. That means healing physically and emotionally
    from the trauma of my disease . I need your help. I’ve started a Fundrazr to make skirts, dresses, and other goodies in
  return for anyone who donates $60 or more. Without your help I will continue to suffer physically. My first goal in this campaign: I believe in holistic healing as well as traditional medicine. I have
  been to numerous neurologists and doctors , but I need a recharge of my spirit. Years of
    battling for my life has left my spirit depleted, which puts my risk for more health problems higher. Elizabeth Gilbert &
  Cheryl Strayed are hosting a four day retreat in Santa Cruz to let go of fear in life and thrive creatively. Living with the specter of death, has had the odd effect of making me fearful of life. I want to
    thrive, without the fear of life, or death, looming over me night
    and day. My initial goal is to raise at least $3,500. Plane Ticket + fees - $600 Workshop Tuition with Commuter Fee + tax - $ 981 .40 Lodging- $ 9 00 Food - $200 The money will also go to making dresses and skirts for you !

      to produce and distribute content from that trip - stories, video
      interivews, photographic essays, articles, and for developing
      social media and web channels to grow awareness and encourage

141,Yolanda's Holistic Breast Cancer Treatments,U.S. Dollar,"Oct 1, 2018",of $50k goal,4,"Trust in the Process ""There are many ways to cure cancer, chemo is not the
    only option."" Yolanda Atwater – a Rock Island, Illinois native: child of God,
    wife, mother of five, and owner of Sisters Hair Salon - had a Breast
    cancer scare in 2000 and decided to change a few things in her diet.
    She decided to stop drinking coffee, pop/soda completely and lowered
    her chocolate intake. Yolanda started taking natural antibiotics and
    has been in great health, until now. Around the time of Yolanda’s breast cancer scare over half of
    her clients were diagnosed with cancer, she immediately took action.
    After helping multiple clients and families through their cancer
    journey, she founded a program called ""Wigs for Cancer”.
    Yolanda also partnered with her eldest daughter Triona in October
    for her annual ""FitN5 Flex For the Fight Fit Tour"" to
    bring awareness to communities about cancer, alopecia, and childhood
    obesity. March 2018 Yolanda was diagnosed with an aggressive tubular
    breast cancer (stage 3+++), being faith-driven she has decided to
    take an alternative route from chemo, prosperity says the Lord . Yolanda continues to fight naturally throughout her process.
    All of the holistic health remedies have had dynamic effects by
    decreasing the size of the cancer tumor, but a much greater system
    is needed. We have discovered a greater natural system called ""An Oasis of Healing"" a holistic healthcare system. WE NEED YOUR HELP NOW! Insurance will not cover any of these natural expenses. Money is running out due
    to Yolanda's inability to work as well as the cost of her natural
    supply. “An Oasis of Healing” has over an 85% success rate of curing
    cancer. Their four-step system is proven to discontinue the
    reproduction of cancerous cells, while targeting cancer only, not
    damaging the immune system but enhancing the immune system. Raising enough money for admission into 'An Oasis of Healing'
    will allow Yolanda to become a walking testimony, to show others
    that there is an alternative healing process instead of
    chemotherapy. Yolanda will not only learn how to eat and live a
    healthy lifestyle but will ultimately give others a new perspective.
    This will allow millions of others who are fighting for survival.
    Wouldn’t you love to be apart of saving millions of peoples lives? Please help Yolanda Atwater through her process by donating, any
    donation counts. $1 x 50,000 ppl = Our Goal of $50,000 $500 x 100 ppl = Our Goal of $50,000 $1000 x 50 ppl = Our Goal of $50,000 $5000 x 10 ppl = Our Goal of $50,000 1000 ppl x $50 = Our Goal of $50,000 500 ppl x $100 = Our Goal of $50,000 1 per x $50,000 = Our Goal of $50,000 This amount does not cover flight, transportation, nor hotel stay. Yolanda would like to leave a few words for you all, she says “I
    have lost too many family members and friends due to cancer, and I
    do not want everyone to think there is only one choice for
    healing."" She encourages individuals to watch a Wrinkle In Time
    for inspiration as this has helped her through her process.

  unusual issues and returned to her doctor. She was resting and doing
  all the things the Dr told her to do, but she kept feeling worse. So
  she decided to get another opinion and see another Dr, who had a few concerns. After 3 1/2 weeks post-baby, tests showed her liver was enlarged and
  excess fluid was in her abdomen requiring a hospital stay to determine
  the cause. More tests, and the determination to send Geni by ambulance
  to Salt Lake City to see specialists and more intense testing. Dr's in
  Salt Lake conferred with a specialist at Stanford U Hospital, and it
  was determined she had all the markers of budd-chiari , a very rare disorder that causes blood clots and
  liver damage. Geni was put on blood thinners hoping to break the clots
  that way, but had to have a procedure through her neck and groin with
  medication shot directly onto the clots to break it up, These
  procedures were hard on Geni, and took hours in the OR. Geni has been
  in the hospital over 2 weeks dealing with recovery. She has been

  supporting the cause. Please use this contact form If you have
  any questions. Otherwise, thank you for your time and consideration of
  this effort to help Thomas Ernst and
  me. --------------------------------------------------- We
  do not have a professional background to create such fundraiser pages
  as this here in the proper way and writing. My English also has
  severe flaws and I apologize for that. It is work in progress as
  we been forced to change the fundraiser platform due to the
  circumstances that prior used crowdfund Youcaring merged with GoFundMe
  and by their policy is Mexico a Non-GoFundMe supported Country
    and they will shut down. You find info on this here You can see screenshots of received donations during the past 2
  weeks here on our blog . The prior campaign did not generate any support since put online June
  2017 until Maria and a local good Samaritan, Francisco Lopez, reached
  out at the Baja Nomads forum and made the
  situation known at the beginning of May 2018. Them folks made already
  a HUGE impact on our life. Having everyday ""real"" food
  (prior eating for weeks beans & rice or Marushan), all medical
  supplies required and having made some payments to most pressing debt
  collectors, have electricity and communication secured. All this is
  already a big relieve creating some breathing space. Also here
  you find the progress in several sets of images from December 2016 on
  until August 2017 when we had to see phone with camera used. Please be
  aware - some of this images are VERY graphical and not for everybody's
  stomach to view!!! Album - Gallery until August 2017 here on Google documents . We have genuinely tried during the past 18 month to progress yet the
  combination of advancing the healing with ambulant treatment (the
  first 6 month 2-3x per week hospital visits), the cost of medication,
  medical supplies and transportation, basic cost of living - rent,
  electricity, telefon, food was in dimensions to large to cope for us.
  Ernst Thomas has no family or relatives, Maria has a small income from
  a clerical position in a hotel working night-shifts. We have sold any valuables to create funds, we have no vehicle. Ernst
  Thomas was still recovering from the impact hurricane Norbert and
  Odile created 2014.",https://fundrazr.com/gofundmyleg
650,Help create balance on the planet through music,U.S. Dollar,,of $2.5k goal,11,"Hi we're Ben & Cassie, founders of Soul Fit NYC, a wellness
  company dedicated to creativity, self expression and healing for all
  people on the planet. Early this year our friend Richard Miller, a brilliant Brazilian
  guitarist approached us about a concern and idea he had to solve it.
  He told us a little known fact: over 60% of professional musicians are
  forced to end their careers early due to injury. Richard knows that it
  doesn't have to be that way. Rather than feeling sorry for himself and
  those affected by injury, he took action. He created an idea for a
  healing retreat in the healing land of Costa Rica, especially for
  guitarists. It's called ""Balanced Guitar."" It's a retreat
  that addresses injury prevention through balance. With yoga, surging,
  Tai Chi, massage, guitar instruction and healing food, Richard knows
  he could make a difference. We loved the idea! Like Richard, Cassie and I saw the possibility of
  this retreat and the huge  impact and possitive benefits this retreat
  could have for anyone who participated (musicians or not). We hit the
  ground running and made Richards dream a reality. This January 5th-13th, Balanced Guitar will happen in the healing
  land of Nosara, Costa Rice. Students from all walks of life and
  economic backgrounds will study guitar technique from brilliant
  teachers like Freddie Bryant (Professional Guitarist, Professor at
  Berklee School of Music & Tai Chi instructor) & Richard Miller
  (professor at Columbia and Driectoe of Programming for the Afro-Latin
  Jazz Alliance in NYC). Iyengar Yoga will be taught by master teacher Rosa Santana. Thai
  Massage will be provided by Cassie Fireman. Surfing lessons will be
  taught by Richard Miller himself. Organic, home cooked meals will be
  cooked by local, Costa Rican chef: Robin. All this costs money and time. We have very little time remaining and
  we have more money to raise. We especially want to raise money to help
  send students to our retreat who can't afford it on their own. Please consider making a donation today. No amount is too small (or
  large) to make a difference. If if you or someone you know would like to attend the retreat, we
  have a few spots left. Check out our website at www.BalancedGuitar.com or email ben@soulfit.nyc for more information. Pura Vida, Ben & Cassie",https://fundrazr.com/815G31
