# Spark Mini Project


## Problem 

In this exercise we will play with Spark Datasets & Dataframes, some Spark SQL, and build a couple of binary classification models using Spark ML (with some MLlib too). The set up and approach will not be too dissimilar to the standard type of approach you might do in Sklearn. Spark has matured to the stage now where for 90% of what you need to do (when analysing tabular data) should be possible with Spark dataframes, SQL, and ML libraries. This is where this exercise is mainly trying to focus.

## Approach

1. Queried SQL table with Spark SQL queries
2. Queried Spark Dataframe with the Dataframe API
3. Built a logistic regression and gradient boosted model that were tuned following a parameter grid.
4. Built ML pipelines in Spark ML

## Deliverables

Python code in Databricks notebook
