# Linear Regression Mini Project


## Problem: Boston Housing Price Prediction
Predict Bostin Housing Price using Boston Housing data set.

## Data
The Boston Housing data set contains information about the housing values in suburbs of Boston. This dataset was originally taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University and is now available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.


## Approach
1. EDA for linear relationships.
2. Linear regression with the Boston Housing data set.
3. Comparing models.
4. Evaluating the model via model assumptions.

## Deliverables
1. EDA & linear regression code in Python notebook.
