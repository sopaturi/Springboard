    "## Prediction Task\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this section was obtained from the exploratory data analysis section. In the previous section, feature engineering was done to create new fields such as the number of missing values in an H1B-LCA application, the wage difference (difference between wage offered and prevailing wage), as well as wage ratio and prevailing wage difference.  Wage ratio refers to the ratio of prevailing wage to wage offered while prevailing wage difference is the difference between prevailing wage listed in the application and the prevailing wage for the position on the Foreign Labor Certification Data Center Online Wage Library.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the prediction task, the final step in the report, is to identify a classfier that best classifies applications as denied or certified. In addition, H1B-LCA application fields that are highly impactful on the application outcome need to be identified so that employers can improve their application success rate in the future.  \n",
    "A classification task will be performed with all of the relevant fields initially so that no important field is mistakenly left out.  The prediction will determine the probability of an application being certified and whether it is denied or certified. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first five applications in the dataset are shown below.  More wrangling steps need to be done such as conversion of categorical variables to numerical variables before classifiers can be applied.\n"

'SOC_CODE' and 'SOC_NAME' also known as occupation code are redundant fields as there is already a job title and industry field. Employment start date, end date, case number, and case submitted do not have any relationship with application outcome. Finally, worksite county and worksite zipcode was removed as there is already a worksite state and city field. Finally, case status indicator was dropped because it is a duplicate of the case status column which is the target variable.\n"

    "The following function is a sampling function that takes in the training data as inputs and outputs a subsample of the data.  In this case, the number of samples was reduced in order to reduce classification time for the subsequent machine learning models.  The originial class imbalance of 98.596 certified applications for 1 denied application was not altered.  Stratified sampling was used instead because changing the target variable ratio would require the probabilities outputted by model to also be calibrated.  The number of samples used for the minority class was 500 while the number of samples for the majority class was 98.596 times the number of denied applications.  "

The probabilities of the predictors given the occurence of the target variable are approximated using a Gaussian distribution.  The advantage of Naive Bayes is that it is computationally fast and does not require hyperparamter tuning.  The disadvantage is that the classifier assumes indpendence of all predictors even though this is rarely the case.  "

    "A decision tree classifier is the simplest of tree methods as it only constructs one tree to perform a classification.  The decision tree finds the best split in a predictor's distribution that seperate the classes of the target variable until a specified tree depth is reached.  An advantage of using a decision tree is that they are simple to understand and interpret as well as visualize. The disadvantage of a decision tree is that they can easily overfit if the max tree depth is too large and only one tree is constructed.  "

    "The random forest classifier is an ensemble method that uses many decision trees that have had bootstrap aggregating or bagging done on the samples. Bagging means that samples are chosen at random with replacement to reduce variance in any single tree.  Random forests in addition take a subset of the predictors when constructing a tree so that each tree is more different from one another.  The combination of the trees made from bagged samples and subsetted predictors is the random forest result.  Compared to a decision tree, a random forest improves accuracy by determining class from the majority of votes for each sample in the many trees."

    "#### E.) Gradient Boosted Classifier\n",

    "\n",
    "A gradient boosted classifier involves combining a large number of trees.  Each subsequent tree that is constructed is done so based on the least pure splits created by the previous tree.  The trees are added back to the previous tree so that the tree can learn slowly and improve classification accuracy.  An advantage to gradient boosted trees is that compared to a decision tree that may overfit to one set of the data because gradient boosted trees learn by focusing on the worst split in a tree and improve over time.  The disadvantages of gradient boosted trees is that they may overfit compared to random forests."

    "### Evaluation and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The original dataset was split into a training and test set with 80% of the data going to the training set while the other 20% went to the test set. The same split ratio was used for all of the models but a random seed was used in each split so that the same samples weren't picked for the training and test sets.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before any of the machine learning models were run on the training data, stratified sampling was used so that the original case status ratio was maintained after the sampling.  The number of samples in the minority class was 500 which means the total number of samples in the training data that was fed into all the models was 49798.  Crossfold validation was used with five folds so that the ML models would fit the training data in such a way that the fit was representative the whole dataset and not just the data from the train-test split.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Two methods of converting categorical fields to numerical fields were used  before ML methods were applied because the methods require that all fields are in numerical format.  The encoding was done while making sure the number of dimensions in the dataset did not increase too much as too many dimensions may lead to overfitting. For fields with less than 10 unique values, the fields were encoded with one hot k-vectors.  While categorical fields with more than 10 unique values were target encoded.  Target encoding means that each unique categorical value in a field was replaced by its average acceptance rate.  A smoothing factor with a value of 1 was introduced to the  average acceptance rate formula so that acceptance rates far from the global mean were pushed towards the global mean.  The average acceptnace rate formula requires there to be one sample in the average, if there is only one unique value, the global mean of acceptance rate is used.  Target encoding does not add extra fields because the categorical values are replaced with numerical ones.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression was used with an L1 penalty.  Because all of the fields were inputted into the model, the L1 penalty was used in order to perform feature selection by adding the absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficient to the loss function.  This penalty causes small coefficients to go to zero and thereby removes negligible features.  A stochastic average gradient descent solver was used in order to decrease computation time as only a subset of the data would be used at a time to fit the model.  The optimal regularization parameter was found to be 0.01 and the tolerance for the stopping criteria was changed to 0.01 from 0.0001 because the classification metrics were similar after the change and computation time decreased.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic regression model identified the features that most influence rejection based on the fact that these features had the lowest coeffcient values.  The top ten features were: WAGE_RATIO, PREVAILING_WAGE, PW_SOURCE_None, PW_UNIT_OF_PAY_None, PW_SOURCE_DBA, VISA_CLASS_E-3 Australian, AGENT_REPRESENTING_EMPLOYER_N, LABOR_CON_AGREE_Y, PW_WAGE_LEVEL_None, WILLFUL_VIOLATOR_None\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier did not have any hyperparameters that needed to be tune.  In addition to this more basic classifier, a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) was run on the training data but the fit was not converging in time so this model was not looked at.   \n",
    "\n",
    "A single decision tree was constructed so that it could be visualized and the splits in the important fields could be identified.  The decision tree had a max tree depth of three after using GridSearch over the range of three to ten.  The top features in the decision tree that determined whether an application was certified or not were WAGE_RATIO, EMPLOYER_NAME, JOB_TITLE, WORKSITE_CITY. According to the decision tree visualization a wage ratio below -0.011 standard deviations from the mean caused all 129 samples to be denied.  Low wage ratio appears to be a sure predictor for application denial.  The other three fields were converted to acceptance rates by target encoding and then scaled so that the decision tree only shows that an employer name with an average acceptance rate less than or equal to -9.165 standard deviations from the mean acceptance rate is predicted to be denied.  A similar reasoning can be used for the other two fields but this does not tell us which employer names are predicted to be denied.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The random forest ensemble method used 250 estimators and the function to measure quality of a split was gini impurity.  More trees could have been used but according to _How Many Trees in a Random Forest?_, \"the analysis of 29 datasets shows that from 128 trees there is no more signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the forests using 256, 512,1024, 2048 and 4096 trees\".  The square root of the number of predictors being fitted were used in each tree. The minimum sample leaf was not tuned in order to decrease computation time.  The top features according to the random forest that contribute to application outcome were EMPLOYER_NAME, AGENT_ATTORNEY_NAME, JOB_TITLE, WORKSITE_CITY, NAICS_CODE, WAGE_RATIO, WAGE_DIFFERENCE, PW_SOURCE_OTHER, WAGE_RATE_OF_PAY_FROM, WAGE_RATE_OF_PAY_TO.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient boosted classifier also used 250 estimators.  The minimum sample leaf as well as learning rate were not tuned in order to decrease computation time. The top features in the gradient boosted classifier that contribute to application denial were EMPLOYER_NAME, WAGE_DIFFERENCE, JOB_TITLE, WORKSITE_CITY, AGENT_ATTORNEY_NAME, PW_SOURCE_OTHER, NAICS_CODE, PW_SOURCE_OES, PREVAILING_WAGE, NEW_EMPLOYMENT.\n",

    "### Conclusions and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "The best performing machine learning classifier was the gradient boosted classifier because it had an AUC of 0.79205, the second highest AUC.  The reason why this classifier is better than the random forest with an AUC of 0.80291 is that its false positive rate is 14% lower than the random forest.  In addition, the gradient boosted classifier achieved the highest F1 score.  The false positive rate is more important to decrease than the false negative rate as just outlined earlier.  The most important features for the gradient boosted classifier were EMPLOYER_NAME, WAGE_DIFFERENCE, JOB_TITLE, WORKSITE_CITY, AGENT_ATTORNEY_NAME, PW_SOURCE_OTHER, NAICS_CODE, PW_SOURCE_OES, PREVAILING_WAGE.  The random forest classifier's top features that are different from the gradient boosted classifier (WAGE_RATIO and WAGE_RATE_OF_PAY_TO) are also important because the AUC for this model was the highest.\n",

    "Based on the top features for both ensemble tree methods, it is apparent that employer name, job title, worksite city, agent attorney name, prevailing wage sources, and industry code with low acceptance rates tend to lead to application denial.  When the difference between prevailing wage and wage offered and the ratio of prevailing wage to wage offered is low, the application tends to be denied.  Applications where the maximum wage offered or the prevailing wage were higher had a higher acceptance rate.  When a prevailing wage source is listed anything other than OES (Occupation Employment Statistics) on the application, the application had a lower acceptance rate.  \n",

    "With the top features that are changeable in mind, it is recommended that an employer who wants a certified H1B-LCA application pays more than the prevailing wage so that wage difference and wage ratio listed are higher.  The maximum wage offered should also be as high as possible as there is a positive correlation between this field and acceptance rate.  In addition, the employer should hire an attorney with a history of a high H1B-LCA acceptance rates and use a prevailing wage from OES.\n",

    "A gradient boosted classifier can be used by employers to check their H1B-LCA applications before they are submitted in order to save the cost of having to submit another application if the first submission fails. \n",

    "In the future in order to improve the AUC for the gradient boosted classifier, more samples need to be used to train the classifier as only 500 samples of minority class were used to decrease computation time.  In addition the number of certified applications in the training data can be downsampled so that the signal from a denied application is stronger. Finally, more  hyperparameters can be searched over for the gradient boosted classifier such as the learning rate an min sample leaf but were not tried in order to decrease fitting time.  Not all of the fields in the application were listed in the original dataset and can possibly be retrieved and included so that performance metrics are improved in a future iteration of this project.\n"
