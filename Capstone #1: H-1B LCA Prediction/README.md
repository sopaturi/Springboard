# Predicting the Likelihood of Acceptance of an H-1B LCA Application

## Soorya Paturi (sopaturi@gmail.com)

### Abstract

—The H-1B visa application is a highly competitive application process that rewards 85,000 applicants
per year with an H-1B visa out of approximately 650,000
applications annually. A preliminary step needed to apply
for the H-1B visa is to apply for an H-1B LCA (Labor
Condition Application), which is done by the employer. The
H-1B LCA application’s main goal is to ensure that the
employer is providing fair work conditions for the foreign
born worker who is applying for the H-1B visa compared
to a citizen who would be applying for the same job. The
H-1B LCA application contains information that pertain
solely to the employer, not the employee. An application
varies in many categories such as job title, employer name,
prevailing wage, and work site city. The goal is to predict
the outcome and the likelihood of acceptance of the H1B LCA application in order to inform an employer what
they can change in their application to increase acceptance
rate.

### INTRODUCTION TO FINAL REPORT ABOVE
THE H-1B visa is is an immigrant visa that
allows foreign born workers to enter the United
States and work temporarily for up to three years
with a possibility of extension for up to six years.
In order for a worker to receive an H-1B visa, an
employer must offer them a position and then submit an H-1B visa application with the Department
of Immigration. H-1B visas are commonly applied
to by international students are who are looking to
work after completing their education in the United
States.
A preliminary step before an H-1B visa application can be filed is the submission of the H-1B LCA
(Labor Condition Application) to the Department of
Labor. The H-1B LCA contains information about
the job title being offered, duration of the job,
whether job is full time, rate of pay, location of
the job, and the prevailing wage in the area. The
purpose of the H-1B LCA is to bind the employer
into paying a fair wage and providing benefits to
a foreign born worker that greater than or equal to
the prevailing wage and benefits in the applicant’s
location.
Currently, there is not a published deterministic
cause for H-1B LCA application denial. However,
the objective is to find a relationship between responses to fields of the application to application
outcome, also known as case status, so that the
likelihood of acceptance can be predicted.
The client, or an entity that is interested in the
findings of this report, is any company that wishes
to hire a foreign born worker. The client should care
about H-1B LCA outcomes because they do not
want to spend time filing and looking for candidates
that will eventually not be certified with a successful
H-1B LCA application. Based on my analysis, the
employer will be able to spend more time finding
competitive candidates for a position instead of
having to resubmit an H-1B LCA application. The
client will have a better chance at having their H-1B
LCA certified by using the findings to change the
application responses to responses that have a high
H-1B LCA certification rate.
The outline of this report is summarized here with
Section II introducing the data set. In section III,
the data wrangling of the data set is summarized by
explaining how the data set was obtained, cleaned,
and wrangled. In section IV, exploratory data analysis of the data is summarized by a field by field
analysis that determines which fields contain values
that may be predictors for application outcome. In
section V, the prediction task is described. In the
last section, section VI, conclusions and next steps
are discussed.
